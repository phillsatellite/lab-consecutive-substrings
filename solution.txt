Function - consecutiveSubstrings

- When given a string the function returns all consecutive substrings that include at least one of the characters 
- Use two nested loops. An outer loop that picks the start index. The inner loop picks the end index
- Slice the string from start to end, then push the result array.
- Return it with all the consecutive substrings

Time Complexity: O(n^2)
- Outter loop runs n times
- Inner loop runs up to n times for each other iteration 

Space Complexity: O(n^2) for storing all substrings
